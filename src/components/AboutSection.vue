            <p>
              Passionate in turning ideas into real, working products. My focus is on clean UI, simple user flows, and building tools that genuinely help people - from fitness companions to study aids and digital experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside development, I design posters, visuals, and product mockups, combining function with aesthetic. I enjoy creating both the software and the visual identity behind it.
            </p>

              Currently pursuing an Application Development major in Information Technology and actively seeking an internship in app, web, or game development. Quick to learn, responsible with tasks, and adaptable to any environment.
